# Xmoll

This is the continuation of one of my first programming projects ever:
A tool to train musical intervals, with way more focus on looks rather than actual functionality. 
Sadly the original code got nuked from the server with no backups (lesson learnt),
so I started a fresh makeover in a slightly more professional manner than the original code.

Still in development. 

## Development

Run `bun install` and `bun run serve`
